# Data-Warehouse-Design
The project aims to design and implement a data warehouse architecture to support analytics. The data warehouse will integrate data from multiple source systems (e.g., sales, marketing, finance), clean and transform the data, and store it in an optimized schema for reporting and analysis. It will include both the design of the warehouse schema and the creation of ETL pipelines.

**Project Components:**
- SQL
- Python (for ETL)
- Git
- Data Modeling (Star Schema)
- Data Warehousing Best Practices

**ETL Pipeline Implementation:**
Extract data from source systems (e.g., databases, APIs, CSV files).
Transform the data (cleaning, aggregation, joining).
Load data into the data warehouse.

**Data Modeling and SQL Code:**
Designing fact and dimension tables in SQL.
Writing queries for data transformations.
Creating views and stored procedures to support analytics.

**Analytics:**
SQL queries for generating reports and performing analysis.
